# SCELLM
Single-Cell Exploratory Large Language Model

Despite rapid growth of single-cell(sc) genomics, datasets from these studies remain inaccessible due to computational barriers. We propose SCELLM, an open-source framework using RAG and agentic LLM to create dynamic, conversational knowledge systems. SCELLM will unify quantitative data with biological context and will be implemented on published data, thus establishing AI-augmented open science that empowers researchers to intelligently utilize sc data in the public domain. 

Problem: PIs/ researchers want to iteratively explore existing single cell data sets (generated or published) but don’t have the bioinformatic experience to query the data. Their paid bioinformaticians are busy working on other products.
Solution: An agentic native language exploration of existing single cell data - through R and utilizing small locally deployed small LLMs. PIs and others can directly ask questions about the data and get visual and textual responses.
Secondary use: Allows bioinformaticians to increase efficiency and reduce code repetition, linking
Method: 
Major Pros:
Small LLMs – can be deployed locally to be portable and protect data/patient privacy, offline access, 
           Curated toolset – Ellmer agentically calls functions that are predefined – to explore a curated/analyzed single cell data set, a vast set of tools will need to be generated. As new methods are developed, new tools can be added
